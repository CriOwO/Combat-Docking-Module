# Combat-Docking-Module
This mod adds a hullmod that allows you to be able to dock with any carrier larger than a frigate. Once you lose 20% of your hull HP, fall below 40% CR, or run out of ammunition, you can turn on autopilot and your ship will navigate to its assigned carrier and land to repair and replenish.
